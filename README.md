# Gradebook-example

An example project from following a plurasight course, and adding my own flavour to some of the code.


This is a command line application that takes a a series of numbers and then calculates a number of
statistics on those numbers inputted. Depending on how the program is complied it will either store
the numbers in memory or in a file text file on the disk.
